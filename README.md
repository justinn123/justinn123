# Hi, I'm Justin Nguyen 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland, with a strong interest in full-stack development. I like building practical, clean, and efficient solutions—whether it’s on the web, in Python, or across the MERN stack.

## 🚀 Main Projects

### **📁 UMD File Share App**

A MERN-based platform that allows students to upload, share, and access class-specific files. Includes authentication, secure file handling, and a clean UI for fast course navigation.

### **🎧 Spotify Tracker**

A web application that displays my Spotify activity in real-time, including my currently playing track, top tracks, and top artists. Built with Flask and hosted on Vercel, it leverages the Spotify API for data retrieval. 

### **📊 Planet Terp Scraper / Professor Summarizer**

A web-application that provides summaries about professors at the University of Maryland. It uses Flask, LangChain, Groq, and Planet Terp data to generate concise, structured insights—including overall sentiment, common course experiences, and average ratings.
